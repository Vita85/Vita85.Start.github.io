## Final web project 

>I created a functional web project based on the Figma layout, using responsive design and integration of dynamic elements.

 To implement the project, I used 
 - SCSS:
    - preprocessor for styling 
    > To ensure clean and organised code, components were created using variables, mixins, and SCSS nesting.
- Bootstrap 5 
    - for creating dynamic components
    > Bootstrap 5 was used to create dynamic elements: pop-up menu, slider, tabs.
